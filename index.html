                            Despite that fact that most of thee books on the site are paid, site distributes one random book for free every day.
                            But once I thought - why do I need to visit this site every day for checking today's free book, if I can do program, which will get info of this book and send it to me and after it
                            I will solve - does it worth to visit site for download this book?

                            Oh, I think this app is the largest and grandest of all that I've ever created. It was my first paid peacework job in web.
                            I did this app from September 2017 to December 2017. Have you ever bought anything? Surely you read the reviews before buying a product, isn't it?
                            We live in an era when anyone can write a product review as he wants. Such a review, of course, may not reflect the truth.
                            So my client wanted to solve this problem - he came up with <a href="https://votzyv.ru">Votzyv</a>. This platform lets entrepreneurs get 
                            the most actual and truly reviews of their products. How does it work? Enterpreneur distributes in social networks (Instagram, VK, Facebook, etc.) 
                            the link on the site where people who use his products can record a review. These reviews are sent to the enterpreneur and due to them he can communicate with 
                            his audience, influence sales, etc. <br>
                            I think, that's very cool idea, that will help people to make the world better.
